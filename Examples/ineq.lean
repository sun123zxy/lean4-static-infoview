## Inequality

### Basics

Inequality is determined by a partial order `PartialOrder`.
A partial order is a relation with reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.
In Lean, a relation means `α → α → Prop` for some type `α`,
capturing the fact that each `a ≤ b` gives a proposition.

`PartialOrder` makes `LE`(`≤`) and `LT`(`<`) available in the context.

/-
A linearly ordered commutative ring is a commutative ring
with a total order s.t addition and multiplication are strictly monotone, e.g. `ℚ`.

In Lean this reads `[CommRing R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]`.

We will work with `ℚ` as an example afterwards.

[TODO] For some reason, `LinearOrder ℚ` is constructed using classical logic.
Don't be surprised if `#print axioms ...` shows some classical axioms.

### Linear order reasoning

A linear order is a partial order with `le_total`: either `a ≤ b` or `b ≤ a`.
-/
#check le_total

/- [EXR] Use this to prove the trichotomy of `<` and `=`. -/
example : a < b ∨ a = b ∨ a > b := by
  rcases le_total a b with (hle | h)
  · by_cases heq : a = b
    · right; left; exact heq
    · left
      apply lt_of_le_of_ne
      · exact hle
      · exact heq
  · -- do it similarly

### Monotonicity of `+`

It's important to recognize that the (strict) monotonicity of `+` is a nontrivial theorem.
That is a part of the meaning of `IsStrictOrderedRing`.

#check add_le_add_left

#### `linarith`

`linarith` is a powerful tactic that solves linear inequalities automatically.
It uses hypotheses in the context and basic properties of linear orders
to deduce the goal.

`linarith only [h1, h2, ...]` use only hypotheses `h1`, `h2`, ... to solve the goal.
-/
#help tactic linarith

example : a < b ↔ a - c < b - c := by
  constructor
  all_goals
    intro
    linarith

example (h : a + b < c + d) : a - d < c - b := by
  linarith

example (h : a > 0) : (2 / 3) * a > 0 := by
  linarith

example (h : (-5 / 3) * a > 0) : 4 * a < 0 := by
  linarith

/- Note the limitations of `linarith`. -/

/- It only works for linear inequalities, not polynomial ones. -/
example : a ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by sorry -- linarith fails here

/- though some of polynomial inequalities can be solved by `nlinarith` -/
#help tactic nlinarith
example : a ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by nlinarith
#check sq_nonneg -- this have a name

/-
It solve all inequalities in a dense linear order.

It does solve some inequalities in discrete linear orders like `ℤ`,
but no guarantee for all of them.
-/
example (n m : ℤ) (h : n < m) : n + 1 ≤ m := by linarith
example (n m : ℤ) (h : n < m) : n + (1/2 : ℚ) ≤ m := by sorry -- linarith fails here

/-
It won't recognize inequalities involving `min`, `max`, `abs`, etc.
It won't recognize some basic `simp` transformations, either.
-/
example (h : a * (min 1 2) > 0) : (id a) ≥ 0 := by
  simp at *
  linarith -- direct `linarith` will fail

/- [EXR] ℚ admits a dense linear order -/
example (hab : a < b) : ∃ c : ℚ, a < c ∧ c < b := by
  use (a + b) / 2
  constructor
  all_goals linarith

/-
#### `simp`

`add_lt_add_iff_right`-like theorems are registered for `simp`,
so sometimes `simp` can reduce things like:
-/
example (h : a + b < c + b) : a < c := by
  simp at h
  exact h

/-
#### `apply_fun`

Sometimes you would like to `apply_fun` at an inequality.
This requires you to manually show the monotonicity of the function.
-/

example (h : a + b < c + d) : a - d < c - b := by
  apply_fun (· - b - d) at h
  · ring_nf at *
    exact h
  · unfold StrictMono
    simp

/- [EXR] Mimick the above example. -/
example (h : a + c ≤ b) : a ≤ b - c := by
  apply_fun (· - c) at h
  · ring_nf at *
    exact h
  · unfold Monotone
    simp

/-
### Monotonicity of `*`

[TODO] It's not needed in the course so far, so we skip it for now.

## `abs`, `min`, `max` and TAOCP

A mature formalizer finds their theorems by themselves.
The art of capturing premises includes, but not limited to:

- `exact?`
- name guessing
- natural language search engine: LeanSearch, LeanExplore, etc.
- mathlib documentation
- AI copilot completion

#check abs

/- [EXR] Find all the below by yourself -/

example : |a| ≥ 0 := by exact abs_nonneg a
example : |-a| = |a| := by exact abs_neg a
example : |a * b| = |a| * |b| := by exact abs_mul a b
example : |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b| := by exact abs_add_le a b
example : |a| - |b| ≤ |a - b| := by exact abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub a b
example : |a| ≤ b ↔ -b ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b := by exact abs_le
example : |a| ≥ b ↔ a ≤ -b ∨ b ≤ a := by exact le_abs'

example (h : a ≥ 0) : |a| = a := by exact abs_of_nonneg h
example (h : a ≤ 0) : |a| = -a := by exact abs_of_nonpos h
example (h : b ≥ 0) : |a| = b ↔ a = b ∨ a = -b := by exact abs_eq h

/-
A mindless way to prove these linear inequalities involving `abs` is
to eliminate all `abs` by casing on the sign of the arguments,
then use `linarith`.
-/
example : |a - c| ≤ |a - b| + |b - c| := by
  all_goals rcases le_total 0 (a - b) with h1 | h1
  all_goals
    try rw [abs_of_nonneg h1]
    try rw [abs_of_nonpos h1]
  all_goals rcases le_total 0 (b - c) with h2 | h2
  all_goals
    try rw [abs_of_nonneg h2]
    try rw [abs_of_nonpos h2]
  all_goals rcases le_total 0 (a - c) with h3 | h3
  all_goals
    try rw [abs_of_nonneg h3]
    try rw [abs_of_nonpos h3]

  all_goals linarith

/- combine brute-force method with theorem-finding -/

  rcases le_total 0 (|a| - |b|) with h1 | h1
  all_goals

    try rw [abs_of_nonpos h1]
  · apply abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub
  · simp only [neg_sub] -- use `simp only` to supress unwanted lemmas
    grw [abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub]
    rw [← abs_neg]
    simp

-- [EXR]
example : |(|a| - |b|)| ≤ |a + b| := by
  rcases le_total 0 (|a| - |b|) with h1 | h1
  all_goals
    try rw [abs_of_nonneg h1]
    try rw [abs_of_nonpos h1]
  · haveI := abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub a (-b)

    exact this
  · haveI := abs_sub_abs_le_abs_sub b (-a)
    simp at *
    grw [this]
    ring_nf

[EXR]
Get familiar with `min`, `max` and solve the following by yourself.
-/
